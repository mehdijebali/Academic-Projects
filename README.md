This repository contains the academic projects of my engineering studies. 
Credit card:
The project aims to launch a marketing campaign for the targeted sale of a new type of credit card. In fact, I studied the dependence between customer characteristics using the PCA method in order to set a correlation strategy. Meanwhile, I analyzed the customer feedback and studied their satisfaction with the gold bank card. This helps me to target the customers who can buy gold cards.

Regularization:
In this project, I studied different types of regularization techniques such as Ridge, Lasso. and I compared its models regarding the generated errors and the overfitting resolution.

Political status:
I performed a web scraping to extract text from the electronic press websites. After that, I mapped the textual extracted data as a table of paragraphs structured by line in order to analyze the political environment of the USA.
