## This repository contains the academic projects related to Data Science.

### Credit card Project (Marketing Campain Analysis):
The project aims to launch a marketing campaign for the targeted sale of a new type of credit card. In fact, I studied the dependence between customer characteristics using the PCA method (Principal Component Analysis) in order to set a correlation strategy between customers. Meanwhile, I analyzed the customer feedback and studied their satisfaction with the gold bank card. This helps me to target who can buy the gold credit card.

### Regularization Project (ML Project):
In this project, I studied different types of regularization techniques such as Ridge, Lasso. and I compared its models regarding the generated errors and the overfitting resolution.

### Political Environment Analysis Project (USA Political Status Analyis):
I performed a web scraping to extract text from the electronic press websites. After that, I mapped the textual extracted data as a table of paragraphs structured by line in order to analyze the political environment of the USA.
